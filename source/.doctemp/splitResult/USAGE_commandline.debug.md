> 
> ```powershell
> PS C:\Users\XXX>
> ```
> 
> This directory is the "*Current working directory*."
> 
> If there is no pathname, try running this command in the terminal:
> 
> ```bash
> pwd
> ```
> 
> After executing this command, a pathname will be output. This pathname is the "**Current working directory**". The translated files will appear here.
