## Adding a Translation Engine

<!-- CHUNK ID: chunk_38A36DFF  CHUNK TYPE: list START_LINE:102 -->
1. Add a new translator configuration class in the `pdf2zh/config/translate_engine_model.py` file.
2. Add an instance of the new translator configuration class to the `TRANSLATION_ENGINE_SETTING_TYPE` type alias in the same file.
3. Add the new translator implementation class in the `pdf2zh/translator/translator_impl` folder.

> [!NOTE]
>
> This project does not intend to support any translation engines with an RPS (requests per second) lower than 4. Please do not submit support for such engines.
> The following types of translators will also not be integrated:
> - Translators that have been discontinued by upstream maintainers (such as deeplx)
> - Translators with large dependencies (such as those depending on pytorch)
> - Unstable translators
> - Translator Based on Reverse Engineering API
>
> When you are unsure whether a translator meets the requirements, you can send an issue to discuss with the maintainers.
