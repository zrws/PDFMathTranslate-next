### Translation Engine Support Policy

<!-- CHUNK ID: chunk_0BB83C9D  CHUNK TYPE: header START_LINE:20 -->
#### Tier 1 (Official Support)

<!-- CHUNK ID: chunk_4E37F5F8  CHUNK TYPE: paragraph START_LINE:22 -->
**Tier 1 translation engines** are directly maintained by the project maintainers. Although the maintainers do **not use this project regularly**, they will rely on GitHub issues to identify problems. When any of these engines encounter issues, the maintainers will fix them as soon as possible to ensure stability and reliability.


Currently supported Tier 1 translation engines include:
<!-- CHUNK ID: chunk_610CC359  CHUNK TYPE: list START_LINE:26 -->
1. SiliconFlowFree
2. OpenAI
3. AliyunDashScope
4. DeepSeek
5. SiliconFlow
6. Zhipu
7. OpenAICompatible

<!-- CHUNK ID: chunk_939CF562  CHUNK TYPE: header START_LINE:34 -->
#### Tier 2 (Community Support)

<!-- CHUNK ID: chunk_35662E12  CHUNK TYPE: paragraph START_LINE:36 -->
**Tier 2 translation engines** are maintained and supported by the community.  
When these engines encounter issues, the project maintainers will not provide direct fixes. Instead, they will label the related issues with `help wanted` and welcome pull requests from contributors to help resolve them.

All engines that are supported by the program but not explicitly listed under Tier 1 are considered Tier 2 translation engines.
